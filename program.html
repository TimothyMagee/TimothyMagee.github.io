                We define a superpotential for a general Schubert variety in the Grassmannian, then use the cluster structure on Schubert varieties to prove that the associated superpotential polytope coincides with a related Newton-Okounkov body.  We also show that our superpotential is the superpotential of a Gorenstein Fano toric variety, which provides a partial desingularization of a toric degeneration of the Schubert variety.  This is joint work with Konstanze Rietsch.

		In this talk I will introduce the notion of a Seshadri stratification on an embedded projective variety. Such a structure allows us to construct (1). a Newton-Okounkov simplicial complex with an extra integral structure; (2). a flat degeneration of the projective variety into a reduced union of toric varieties. For Schubert varieties, Lakshmibai-Seshadri paths got interpretation as successive vanishing orders of certain regular functions within this framework. This talk bases on joint works with Rocco Chirivì and Peter Littelmann.

		Gorenstein toric Fano varieties play a crucial role in the famous Batyrev-Borisov mirror construction. In this talk, I will explore new challenges that arise when generalising from toric to spherical varieties — a remarkable class of algebraic varieties equipped with an action of a connected complex reductive group, where a Borel subgroup acts with an open dense orbit. This class includes flag varieties, toric varieties, symmetric spaces, and their equivariant compactifications. I will present joint work in progress with Girtrude Hamm, where we classify all 4-dimensional Gorenstein spherical Fano varieties. Our work extends the renowned Kreuzer-Skarke database and the recent classification by Delcroix-Montagard of 4-dimensional Gorenstein spherical Fano varieties of rank less than or equal to 2. This classification is obtained in terms of polytopes that generalise reflexive polytopes and relies on an algorithm that is inspired by Kasprzyk’s approach to enumerating toric Fano 3-folds with terminal singularities. Similar to the toric case, the geometric properties of the underlying variety, such as the Picard rank and anticanonical degree, can be described combinatorially in terms of these more general polytopes. If time permits, I will conclude with examples illustrating our preliminary observations and ongoing efforts in understanding the mirror symmetry of Gorenstein spherical Fano varieties.

		    Let \(G\) be a semisimple group over \(\mathbb{C}\). Let \(\beta\) be a positive braid whose Demazure product is the longest Weyl group element. The braid variety \(M(\beta)\) generalizes many well known varieties, including positroid cells, open Richardson varieties, and double Bruhat cells. We provide a concrete construction of the cluster structures on \(M(\beta)\), using the weaves of Casals and Zaslow and a new combinatorial construction called Lusztig cycles. We show that the coordinate ring of \(M(\beta)\) is a cluster algebra, which confirms a conjecture of Leclerc as special cases. As an application, we show that \(M(\beta)\) admits a natural Poisson structure and can be further quantized. This talk is based on joint work with Roger Casals, Eugene Gorsky, Mikhail Gorsky, Ian Le, and Jose Simental.

		One way of constructing mirror partners to Fano varieties is via toric degenerations. The case in which this is best understood is the Grassmannian, using the well-known SAGBI basis of the Plucker coordinate ring indexed by semi-standard Young tableaux (SSYT). The mirror construction goes back to work of Eguchi&#8209;Hori&#8209;Xiong, however its geometry and combinatorics still plays an important role in current mirror constructions. In this talk, I will give an overview of this story, then turn to the question of what can be generalized for Kronecker moduli spaces. Like Grassmannians (which they generalize), Kronecker moduli spaces are high Fano index Picard rank 1 smooth Fano varieties. I will introduce linked SSYT pairs, which play the analogous role of SSYT for Grassmannians in understanding the coordinate ring of the Kronecker moduli space. This is joint work with Liana Heuberger.

		Chan, Leung and Ma showed how asymptotic analysis of Maurer-Cartan solutions in an appropriate differential graded Lie algebra gives rise to the consistent scattering diagrams appearing in the construction of mirror families by Kontsevich-Soibelman and Gross-Siebert. This approach was then generalized by Leung, Ma and Young providing a consistent completion of refined scattering diagrams and the associated theta functions. Based on these results we show that the consistent completion of an initial scattering diagram in \(M_\mathbb{R}\) for a finite rank lattice \(M\) can be expressed in terms of the Jeffrey-Kirwan residues of certain explicit meromorphic forms. A similar description holds for the associated theta functions. This is joint work with Jacopo Stoppa.

		Reid's recipe is an equivalent of the McKay correspondence in dimension three. It marks interior line segments and lattice points in the fan of the \(G\)-Hilbert scheme with characters of irreducible representations of \(G\). In joint work with Craw and Tapia Amador, we generalise this by marking the toric fan of a crepant resolution of any affine Gorenstein singularity, in a way that is compatible with both the \(G\)-Hilbert case and its categorical counterpart known as Derived Reid's Recipe. To achieve this, we foray into the combinatorial land of quiver moduli spaces and dimer models. In this talk I will discuss connections between combinatorial and derived Reid's recipe and recent progress concerning low-valency vertices in the quiver. This is joint work with Alastair Craw.

		Given a pair of mirror dual affine log Calabi-Yau varieties \(X\) and \(Y\), the Gross-Siebert program associates a theta function on \(X\) to each boundary valuation on \(Y\). Since mirror duality is a symmetric relation, there are two ways to associate an integer to a pair \((m,n)\) of boundary valuations on \(X\) and \(Y\). 1) Apply the valuation \(m\) to the theta function associated to \(n\). 2) Apply the valuation \(n\) to the theta function associated to \(m\). Resolving a conjecture of Gross-Hacking-Keel-Kontsevich, we show that these two numbers are equal in a generality which covers all cluster algebras (specifically, when the theta functions are given by enumerating broken lines in a scattering diagram generated by finitely-many elementary incoming walls). Time permitting, I will discuss applications to tropicalizations of theta functions, Donaldson-Thomas transformations, and localizations of cluster algebras. This work is joint with Man-Wai Cheung, Tim Magee, and Travis Mandel.

		Using the Batyrev-Borisov duality for nef-partitions as a motivation, I will discuss a new theory of convex geometry in certain piecewise linear manifolds. The interest of these piecewise linear manifolds (tropical spaces) is that they arise naturally in the study of mirror symmetry for cluster varieties. We expect that this broken line convex geometry will encode the algebraic geometry of compactifications of cluster varieties, just like the algebraic geometry of toric varieties is encoded by usual convex polyhedral geometry. In this talk, the notions of Minkowski sum, polyhedral complexes and duality of polytopes in this setting will be discussed. Finally, I will present the advances of the broken line convex geometry version of the Batyrev-Borisov duality. Based on ongoing joint work with Timothy Magee.

		The Hilbert scheme of points on a smooth, projective surface \(X\) is a smooth, projective variety parametrizing finite closed subschemes of \(X\). In this talk, I will describe Newton-Okounkov bodies and valuation semigroups for all ample divisors on the Hilbert schemes of points on \(\mathbb{P}^1\times\mathbb{P}^1\). The valuation semigroups are not finitely-generated, so one does not get toric degenerations of the Hilbert schemes. However, we can give explicit formulas for the corresponding Hilbert series which, thanks to structural results of  Ellingsrud, Göttsche, and Lehn, determines the Euler characteristic of any line bundle on the Hilbert scheme of points on any smooth, projective surface.
